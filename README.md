# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my GitHub

Thanks for stopping by! I'm Kristers, a passionate software developer working with JavaScript, React Native, SwiftUI, and backend technologies like Node.js, Laravel, ASP.NET.

All of my side projects are currently in **private repositories**. Some are being prepared for production release, while others are still in early development stages and not ready for public view.

That said, feel free to reach out or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristers-gutmanis-66395995/) if you'd like to discuss my work or potential collaborations.
